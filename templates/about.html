                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>ThyroPredict aims to democratize thyroid health assessment by leveraging cutting-edge machine learning technology. We believe that early detection and awareness are crucial in managing thyroid disorders and improving overall health outcomes.</p>
                <p>Our vision is to create a world where individuals have easy access to accurate, personalized thyroid health insights that empower them to take proactive steps toward better health.</p>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>Our advanced machine learning model is trained on extensive clinical data to identify patterns and risk factors associated with thyroid disorders. By analyzing your hormone levels (TSH, T3, T4), antibodies, age, and other clinical markers, we provide personalized risk assessments.</p>
                <p>The model generates tailored recommendations for supplements, dietary changes, and suggests consulting with healthcare professionals for comprehensive evaluation.</p>
